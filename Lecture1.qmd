-   Developed methods for staining tissue made it possible to distinguish between different types of blood cells, which led to the ability to diagnose numerous blood diseases → **"magic bullet hypothesis"**

-   First screening of chemical libraries to identify active antibacterial compounds (synthetic compounds)

-   First effective treatment for syphilis- arsphenamine (Salvarsan) 1909

Side effects attributed to Salvarsan, included rashes, liver damage, and risks of life and limb, were thought to be caused by improper handling and administration of the relatively insoluble compound

## Alexander Fleming (1881-1955): The serendipitous discovery

<br> \<<br>

-   Fleming was skilled at administering Salvarsan to patients with syphilis, which led to a small but profitable practice
-   During World War I, Fleming worked in a wound-research laboratory and discovered that chemical antiseptics do not sterilize jagged wounds, and pus has its own antibacterial powers
-   After the war, Fleming focused on studying leukocytes and antisepsis, and in 1921 he discovered lysozyme, a substance that causes bacteria to disintegrate, but its effectiveness was limited against disease-causing bacteria

::::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}

-   Prontosil metabolized to sulfanilamide *in vivo,* initially found to be inactive in microbiological assays
-   Among the early patients was Domagk’s own 6-year-old daughter, Hildegard, who had contracted a severe streptococcal cellulitis from an accident with a sewing needle
-   Utterly desperate when the doctor recommended amputation to save his daughter’s life, Domagk treated Hildegard with Prontosil.
-   Hildegard recovered, but suffered a permanent reddish discolouration of her skin owing to the drug

## Challenge: How to produce enough penicillin?

<br>

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/heatleys_fermenter.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
<br>

-   It was difficult to ferment enough crude peniciilin and to gain samples with few impurities
-   Heatley’s inventiveness shown both in this device and in his design of a dish to grow the mould at an experimental scale was of great importance to the development of penicillin

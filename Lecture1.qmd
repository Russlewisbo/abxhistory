Side effects attributed to Salvarsan, included rashes, liver damage, and risks of life and limb, were thought to be caused by improper handling and administration of the relatively insoluble compound

<br> <br> <br>

-   Fleming was skilled at administering Salvarsan to patients with syphilis, which led to a small but profitable practice
-   During World War I, Fleming worked in a wound-research laboratory and discovered that chemical antiseptics do not sterilize jagged wounds, and pus has its own antibacterial powers
-   After the war, Fleming focused on studying leukocytes and antisepsis, and in 1921 he discovered lysozyme, a substance that causes bacteria to disintegrate, but its effectiveness was limited against disease-causing bacteria

-   Prontosil metabolized to sulfanilamide *in vivo,* initially found to be inactive in microbiological assays
-   Among the early patients was Domagk’s own 6-year-old daughter, Hildegard, who had contracted a severe streptococcal cellulitis from an accident with a sewing needle
-   Utterly desperate when the doctor recommended amputation to save his daughter’s life, Domagk treated Hildegard with Prontosil.
-   Hildegard recovered, but suffered a permanent reddish discolouration of her skin owing to the drug

<br>

-   It was difficult to ferment enough crude peniciilin and to gain samples with few impurities
-   Heatley’s inventiveness shown both in this device and in his design of a dish to grow the mould at an experimental scale was of great importance to the development of penicillin

-   Dorothy Hodgkin, a crystallography expert at Oxford University, used X-rays to analyse the structure of various natural products 

-   In 1946, she determined the structure of penicillin, earning her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964

-   Knowledge of the penicillin structure allowed scientists to modify penicillin, leading to the development of semisynthetic versions with broadened spectrum of activity, incrased stability, reduced toxicity

-   Bronzu performed epidemiological studies of typhoid infection in Cagliari, noted *Salmonella typhi* was not cultured once sewer water was discharged into the sea
-   Isolated the mold *Cephalosporium* (now known as *Acremonium*) in 1948 from seawater
-   Noticed that these cultures produced substances (he named mycetin) that were effective against *Salmonella typhi*, the cause of typhoid fever, which had beta-lactamase.
-   After he failed to find support from Italian government, he sent the fungus to Howard Florey at Oxford

-   Selman Waksman and his team at Rutgers University discovered multiple antimicrobials in the 1940s, including actinomycin, streptomycin, and neomycin

-   Their research focused on studying fungi and Actinobacteria, with a particular emphasis on soil bacteria belonging to the Streptomyces genus

-   Streptomyces bacteria were found to naturally produce a wide range of antimicrobials, leading to the discovery of these important compounds

-   **Wakesman is credited with introduction of the term “antibiotic”**
